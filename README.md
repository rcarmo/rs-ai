[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A Rust port of [@earendil-works/pi-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-ai) — unified LLM API with automatic model discovery, streaming, tool calling, and multi-provider support.

> **⚠️ Early scaffold.** This crate is in initial development. The type system, event protocol, and registry are in place; provider implementations are being ported.

## Known limitations

Tracks `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.79.4`. Known divergences from upstream:

- **Google Vertex AI auth**: response decoding matches Gemini, but production Vertex
  auth (GCP Application Default Credentials / service-account token exchange and the
  project/location-scoped endpoint) is not implemented — it would require a GCP auth
  dependency. Vertex models fall back to the shared Gemini request path.
- **Provider SDK retries**: upstream relies on vendor SDK retry behavior. This port
  honors `StreamOptions` retry fields (`max_retries`, `max_retry_delay_ms`,
  `retry_config`) via `retry::do_with_retry` across the HTTP providers; Bedrock uses
  the AWS SDK's own retry. There is no implicit default retry when no options are set.
